# Overview

This project is a simple **Kotlin Calculator application** written in Kotlin.  
The purpose of this software is to gain hands-on experience with the Kotlin programming language and practice building an interactive console-based calculator with multiple operations and history tracking.  

The application demonstrates how to:
- Write a `main` function in Kotlin  
- Take user input and handle basic control flow  
- Perform mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`, `sqrt`)  
- Display and manage calculation history  
- Build and run a Kotlin program from the command line or VS Code
